	<p><b>The injured Dallas Cowboys defensive back made it clear watching Monday Night Football last night: his brother, Stefon, needs to get out of Buffalo ASAP!</b></p><br>
	<p>There is some MAJOR drama in Buffalo! The Bills offense is a shadow of itself in 2023 from external and internal stressors. Last night, QB Josh Allen and the hometown Bills struggled in a third loss in four weeks.</p>
	<p>This time to the often self-destructive Denver Broncos.</p>
	<p>But last night's game highlighted a growing concern amongst Buffalo fans.</p>
	<p>Josh Allen is a turnover machine who tries to do too much. The frustration of the skill players is boiling over to the point that the offensive coordinator - Ken Dorsey - was fired. Head coach Sean McDermott finds himself firmly on the hot seat with his talented squad now 5-5.</p>
	<p><h2><b>Stefon Diggs, especially, has been frustrated.</b></h2></p>
	<p>The elite wideout has been seen vocalizing his frustrations with the coaching staff and his QB on the sideline during games over the last season and a half.</p>
	<p>Those frustrations might boil over into more if his brother - Dallas Cowboys DB Trevon Diggs - has any idea what his brother is going through/feeling about the trajectory of the franchise.</p>

	<p>Shots fired? Shots fired!</p>
	<p>Trevon made it clear - and then doubled down - that one, Allen is not doing enough to get his brother the ball. And two, Buffalo is not the right place for the talented pass-catcher.</p>
	<p>Does Trevon's word carry any weight? It sure does!</p>
	<p>Stefon might not be feeling as negatively as his brother might indicate on Twitter, but there must be some truth to it.</p>
	
	<p>Look at what has happened to Diggs' production in recent weeks.</p>
	
	<p>He had over 100 yards receiving yards in five of the first six games.
	He has not hit the century mark in the last four.</p>
	<b><h2>Is this Stefon's last <br>year with the Bills?</h2></b>
	<p>Rumblings on social media suggest that we could see a split between Stefon Diggs and the Buffalo Bills similar to the one we saw with the Minnesota Vikings a few years ago.
	That may depend on how the offense does down the stretch - and whether or not the Bills make the postseason.</p>
	<h3><b>Could the Diggs brothers be partnering up with the Dallas Cowboys next season? I could see it happening!</b></h3>
